# zoom-poof
This is a small web application running on a Raspberry Pi that allows remote control of propane poofing devices.  The interface prompts the user to enter a poofing sequence which is then queued up by the RPi and used to control the propane solenoids.  Additionally, if the video chat is happening on Zoom, a closed captioned message will be displayed to all participants showing who's selection is being played.  We're running this on a Raspberry Pi Zero using standard relays.

This project was motivated by a recent Zoom call where I had set up 4 tiki torch poofers and was the only one that could push the button.
